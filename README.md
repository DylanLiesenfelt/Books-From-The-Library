# Books From The Library

I'm just short-hand copying books from the library. Why?
* I learn more effectively when I am writing (typing) what I am reading, compared to just reading.
* It is good for notes.
* I have a copy of the book forever as long as I have internet access to the internet or the repo on my computer.

Please dont sue me, I am just a lil rascal!
